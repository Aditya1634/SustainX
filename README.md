# SustainX
## We Turn Your Trash into Cash!

SustainX is a platform which makes the trash collection process easier for both the customer and the collector. We aim to reduce the natural resource and mineral mining and gives back the raw product to a centralised system which gives it back to those who need it and hence promotes a circular economy.

Global economy has traditionally followed a linear model of take-make-waste, in which resources are extracted, used once, and then discarded as waste. Most significant impact of the linear economy is the depletion of natural resources along with serious environmental impacts and massive waste generation. 
The Global Economy is now only 7.2% circular leaving a huge Circularity Gap for which the reason being : An absence of a centralised system for efficient trash collection, segregation, providing supply to recycling plants and putting raw materials generated back into the economy.

The real concern regarding the environment wellbeing and how it affects the overall wellbeing of everyone related to the environment was ultimate inspiration. Japan's town, Kamikatsu, with a population of 1344 people, is a waste free city with ‘Zero Waste Declaration’ all by the collaborative help of the people living there. Replacing the take-make-dispose model with a make-use-return model to transform into a circular economy is the ultimate game changer in saving the environment. The TEDx Talk of Cillian Lohan on Circular Economy also gave a sense of inspiration and idea for the same.
